4.Write a shell script that accepts one or more file names as arguments and converts all of them into uppercase, provided they exist in the current directory.

**Create a file and name it as rename_upper.sh

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 file1 [file2 ... fileN]"
    exit 1
fi

for filename in "$@"
do
    if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
        uppername=$(echo "$filename" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')

        if [ "$filename" != "$uppername" ]; then
            # Rename via temp if uppercase exists (for case-insensitive FS)
            tempname="_temp_$$"
            mv "$filename" "$tempname"
            mv "$tempname" "$uppername"
            echo "Renamed '$filename' to '$uppername'"
        else
            echo "'$filename' is already in uppercase. Skipping."
        fi
    else
        echo "File '$filename' does not exist in current directory."
    fi
done
